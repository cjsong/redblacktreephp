This is a port of Emin Martinian's Red Black Tree implementation in C code to PHP 5 code base. Emin's C code could be found at [http://www.mit.edu/~emin/source\_code/index.html ](.md)

Essentially, this code tries to implement the Red Black Tree pseudo code found in Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) book.

I wrote "tries" to implement because there are couple of Red Black Tree demos out on the web that produces different results. At the end though, the tree structure is a valid Red Black Tree structure.
